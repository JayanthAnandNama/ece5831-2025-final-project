# Ece5831-2025 Final Project

# Stock Market Value Prediction
By: Jayanth Nama, Vrunda 


# Project Overview

This project investigates stock market value prediction using a variety of sequence-based deep learning models. Since financial time series exhibit strong temporal dependencies and non-stationary behavior, we explore multiple neural architectures to understand how well they capture trends, volatility, and short-term dynamics.

The project includes both learned models and baseline methods to highlight the strengths and limitations of different approaches. Model performance is evaluated using quantitative metrics as well as visual comparisons against actual stock price movements.

# Models Implemented

- Simple RNN
- LSTM
- GRU
- Transformer Encoder
- CNN + BiLSTM + Attention
- Random Walk 
- Over-Regularized Deep LSTM


# Evaluation Approach

Models are evaluated using:
Regression-based metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R², Max Error) 
Directional Accuracy
Visual comparisons (actual vs. predicted, overlay plots, zoomed-in views)
This combination provides insight into accuracy, robustness, trend-following ability, and risk.
